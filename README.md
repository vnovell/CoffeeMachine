# **Coffee Machine**
## A simple code for a coin-op Coffee Machine

- choose between 3 hot flavours: espresso, latte or capuccino (or type 'report' for a resources report)
- check if there's resources enough to make the order
- process coins (with refund and change, if needed)
- makes coffee (adds money, reduces resources)
